## Data Modeling with Postgres


#### Introduction
Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. Their analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app. The goal is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis.


#### Project Description
In this project, I have created a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. I have defined fact and dimension tables for a star schema for the particular analytic focus, and written an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.


#### Datasets

###### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.\
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json\
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.\
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

###### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.\
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json\
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

#### Database Design (Schema for Song Play Analysis)
Using the song and log datasets, I have created a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables:

###### Fact Table
**songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
  * songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

###### Dimension Tables
**users** - users in the app
  * user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level

**songs** - songs in music database
  * song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration

**artists** - artists in music database
  * artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude

**time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
  * start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday


#### Project Files
In addition to the data files, the project includes five files:
* *test.ipynb* displays the first few rows of each table to check your database.
* *create_tables.py* drops and creates the tables. This file can be run to reset the tables each time before the ETL scripts are run.
* *etl.ipynb* reads and processes a single file from song_data and log_data and loads the data into the tables. This notebook contains detailed instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables.
* *etl.py* reads and processes files from song_data and log_data, and loads them into the tables.
* *sql_queries.py* contains all the sql queries, and is imported into the last three files above.


#### How To Run the Project
Run etl.py to process all the files under given path and insert the records into respective tables. You can use test.ipynb to check if records are inserted into respective tables.
